<h2><u>How Hockey was created</u></h2>
<p><font color="olive"> The roots of hockey are a topic of discussion because stick-and-ball games have been played for ages in many civilizations. But ice hockey as we know it today originated in Canada. It was at the Victoria Skating Rink in Montreal, Canada, in 1875 that the first organized indoor hockey match was ever played. This game was played on ice with a ball and sticks and included components from other stick-and-ball sports. The game started to take shape with uniform rules and gear over time. The Amateur Hockey Association of Canada (AHAC) created the first set of official ice hockey rules in 1886, contributing to the sport's formalization and easier national adoption. Ice hockey became very popular in Canada, and then it expanded to other countries. Since then, the sport has seen great progress and improvement, including the creation of worldwide contests and cutting-edge tools and tactics. Millions of people play and enjoy hockey both professionally and recreationally nowadays.</font>

<h2><u>Description of Hockey</u></h2>
<ol><font color="black"> Two teams, each consisting of six players on the rink simultaneously, plus a goalie, set up the game. A typical hockey game consists of three quarters, with 20 minutes of playtime each. Teams can rest in between periods during the breaks. The puck is dropped by the referee in the face-off in the middle of the rink, and players from both teams try to take possession of it. </font>
