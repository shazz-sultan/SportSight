<h2> <a name="History Of Basketball"> <i><u> The History of Cricket</I></u> </a2> 
</h2><p> Cricket, with its origins deeply rooted in England, has a rich and fascinating history that spans over several centuries. The game is believed to have evolved from rural games played in England during the medieval period, with early references dating back to the 16th century. By the 18th century, cricket had gained popularity among the English nobility and aristocracy, becoming a significant social pastime. The Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), founded in 1787, played a crucial role in standardizing the rules of the game, laying the foundation for modern cricket. The 19th century witnessed cricket's expansion beyond England, with the first international match played between the United States and Canada in 1844. The formation of the Imperial Cricket Conference (now the International Cricket Council) in 1909 marked a significant step towards organizing international cricket. Over the years, the sport has evolved, embracing innovations such as limited-overs cricket and Twenty20 formats, leading to its widespread popularity globally, particularly in countries like India, Australia, and Pakistan, where cricket is more than just a gameâ€”it's a passion that unites millions.</p>
<br> <h2><u><i> What is Cricket? </h2></u></i>
<h2><p> Cricket, a bat-and-ball game is played between two teams on an oval-shaped field. The primary objective for each team is to score more runs than their opponent. A run is scored by striking the ball with a bat and running to the opposite end of the pitch. The batting team aims to prevent the ball from hitting their wicket while scoring runs, while the bowling team seeks to dismiss the batsmen and limit the runs scored. Cricket is governed by a set of rules established by the International Cricket Council (ICC), with matches officiated by umpires. There are three main formats of cricket: Test cricket, One Day International (ODI), and Twenty20 (T20), each offering a unique playing experience.<h2><p>

<h2><u><i> How Cricket is Played </h2></u></i>
 
<h3>Cricket is played between two teams, each consisting of eleven players. The objective of the game is to score runs by hitting the ball with a bat and running between two sets of wooden stumps called "wickets." The game takes place on an oval-shaped field with a rectangular strip in the center known as the "pitch." Players on the batting team try to score runs while those on the fielding team aim to dismiss the batsmen and prevent runs. The bowler delivers the ball to the batsman, who tries to hit it to score runs. Fielders attempt to catch the ball or run out the batsmen.</h3>
