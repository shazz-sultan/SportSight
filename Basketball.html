<h2> <a name="History Of Basketball"> <i><u> The History of Basketball </i></u> </a2> </h2><p>
<font size="+1">Basketball was invented by Dr. James Naismith in 1891 as a way to keep students active during the winter months. It quickly gained popularity, leading to the formation of professional leagues like the BAA, which later merged to form the NBA in 1949. The NBA became the premier basketball league globally, producing iconic players such as Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, and LeBron James. Internationally, FIBA oversees the sport's development, organizing events like the Basketball World Cup and the Olympics. With its fast-paced action and global appeal, basketball continues to captivate audiences worldwide, evolving with new stars like Stephen Curry and LeBron James. </font> </p>

<h2><u><i> How Basketball is Played </h2></u></i>
<font size="+1"> Basketball is played between two teams of five players each, with the objective of scoring points by shooting the ball through the opponent's hoop. The game is played on a rectangular court with a hoop at each end. Players move the ball by dribbling (bouncing) it while running or passing it to teammates. </font>
<br>
<h3><i> KEY RULES </h3></i>
<li><b> Dribbling: </b> Players must dribble the ball while moving, bouncing it with one hand at a time. </li> 
<br>
<li><b> Shooting: </b> Points are scored by successfully shooting the ball through the opponent's hoop. Different shots are worth different points, with a regular field goal counting for two points and shots made from beyond the three-point line counting for three points. </li>
<br>
<li><b> Passing: </b> Players can pass the ball to teammates to advance it towards the opposing team's basket. </li>
<br>
<li><b> Defense: </b> Players must prevent the opposing team from scoring by blocking shots, stealing the ball, and contesting passes. </li>
<br>
<li><b> Fouls: </b> Certain actions, such as excessive physical contact or violations of the rules, result in fouls. Fouls can lead to free throws, where the fouled player gets an uncontested shot at the basket from the free-throw line. </li>
<br>
<li><b> Time: </b> The game is divided into quarters (typically four) with a halftime break. Each quarter lasts a set amount of time (usually 12 minutes in professional games). The team with the most points at the end of regulation time wins. </li>
