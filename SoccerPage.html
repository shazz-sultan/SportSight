<h2><u>The history of soccer goes back thousands of years</u></h2>
<p><font color = black>The evolution of soccer in the 70s,80s,90d till today have had a significant dominance and a Global impact.
During the 12th century, what you could call the “bare bones” of soccer was being played in the meadows of England.
This early version was called ‘Folkball,’ and while it barely resembles the modern sport, as it involved punching the ball with your fist and violently tackling the opposing team, it did focus on kicking. But the game was far too violent.
It wasn’t until the 1800s after the British government had banned it for centuries, that it was re-established as a winter sport with much safer rules. The game was played between English public schools like Eton, Winchester, and Charterhouse.
The only problem was that each school had its own rules. Some allowed the limited carrying of the ball, like rugby, while others didn’t allow players to touch it.
The different rules made it hard for schools to compete. That is until 1848 when the Cambridge Rules were adopted.
These rules were the first set of widely accepted soccer laws, but they still didn’t specify whether the ball could be handled.
So,in 1863 the first Football Association (FA) was formed in London to standardize all rules relating to soccer.
That’s when soccer and rugby became two separate sports and touching the ball with your hands became illegal.</font color>
