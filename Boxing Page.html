    <h1>Boxing</h1>
    <p>What is Boxing?</p>
    <p>Boxing is a combat sport in which two people, usually wearing protective gloves and other gear such as hand wraps and mouthguards, throw punches at each other for a predetermined amount of time in a boxing ring.</p>
    
    <h2>Evolution of Boxing</h2>
    <p>Boxing has ancient origins, with evidence of contests dating back to ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome. Modern boxing emerged in England in the late 19th century with the establishment of formal rules and regulations. Over the years, it has evolved into a highly regulated sport with various weight classes, governing bodies, and championship titles.</p>

    <h2>Boxing Pay</h2>
    <p>The pay that boxers receive can vary widely depending on factors such as skill, popularity, and bout significance. Top-tier professionals, especially titleholders or those in high-profile matches, can earn millions per fight through purses, pay-per-view bonuses, endorsements, and other sources. However, many boxers, especially those early in their careers or at lower levels, may earn considerably less.</p>
    
    <p>Despite the potential for high earnings, professional boxing can be physically demanding and dangerous, with boxers risking injury and long-term health issues as they compete at the highest levels.</p>
